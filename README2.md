# practicerepo
This repo can be used for practicing pull requests, forks, etc.

Below is one idea of something to do during the mini-workshop.  The indented code is for command line users.  GUI users will hopefully see buttons that do the same thing.

1.  Clone the repository (git@github.com:jduss4/practicerepo.git)
    
    `git clone git@github.com:jduss4/practicerepo.git`

2.  Make a new branch (feel free to call it anything you like)!

    `git checkout -b new_branch_name`
    
3.  Add a new file, then "stage" it, commit it, and push it to your new branch

    `git status`   # verify that you added a file
    `git add file_name`
    `git commit -m "commit message"`
    `git push origin branch_name`
    
4.  Go look at your change in github!  Feel free to add more files or make some more commits.  If you are feeling bold, change a file that you think somebody else might be working on.  Now, open a pull request!

5.  Go look at your pull request in GitHub.  Make some comments on other pull requests that you see.


If you make an HTML page, you can preview it by adding `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?` to the beginning of the file url in GitHub.
For example, this is the welcome page:  http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jduss4/practicerepo/blob/master/welcome.html
