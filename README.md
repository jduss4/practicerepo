# practicerepo
This repo can be used for practicing pull requests, forks, etc.

Once added as collaborators, students can mess around with this repository.

Generally, it is a good idea when you're working with a group to work independently
on small chunks of code or features and then make a pull request.  This way,
everybody can see what you are adding / removing, make comments, and raise objections.
